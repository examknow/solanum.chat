---

Includes changes from charybdis-4.1.3-dev.

**This release includes breaking changes.** Please pay close attention to bolded
warnings in the full release notes below.

build
=====

* Add ``--with-asan`` to configure to produce an ASan instrumented build

server protocol
===============

* OPER is now propagated globally, as :operator OPER opername privset

user
====

* **Breaking:** invite-notify is now enabled by loading the invite-notify extension
* Prioritise older, more important client capabilities for clients that can only accept
  one line of CAP LS
* Add the `solanum.chat/realhost </realhost>`_ vendor capability (provided by extensions/cap_realhost)
* Add the `solanum.chat/identify-msg </identify-msg>`_ vendor capability (provided by extensions/identify_msg)
* Server-side aliases preserve protocol framing characters
* Add the +G user mode for soft callerid (implicitly allow users with a common channel)
* :kbd:`/invite` no longer punches through callerid
* invite-notify now works
* Rejectcached users are now sent the reason of the ban that caused their reject in most cases
* Rejectcache entries expire when their corresponding K-lines do
* One-argument :kbd:`/stats` and zero-argument :kbd:`/motd` are no longer ratelimited
* Channel bans don't see through IP spoofs
* Global :kbd:`/names` now respects userhost-in-names
* The ``$j`` extban is no longer usable inside ban exceptions

oper
====

* **Breaking:** Kick immunity for override is now its own extension, override_kick_immunity
* **Breaking:** :kbd:`/stats A` output now follows the same format as other stats letters
* **Breaking:** helpops now uses ``+h`` instead of ``+H``
* Opers now have their privset (identified by name) on remote servers
* Oper-only umodes are refreshed after rehash and :kbd:`/grant`
* Extension modules can be reloaded
* Override no longer spams about being enabled/disabled. It continues to spam on each use.
* Add :kbd:`/testkline`, which has the same syntax as :kbd:`/testline` but doesn't check if the mask is ilined
* :kbd:`/privs` is now remote-capable and can respond with more than one line
* Most commands now respect oper hiding
* Massnotice (notice/privmsg to $$.../$#...) now alerts opers
* Massnotice no longer imposes any restrictions on the target mask
* :kbd:`/kline` and :kbd:`/dline` are hardened to invalid inputs
* K/D-lines are more consistent about checking for encoded ipv4-in-ipv6 addresses
* Add extensions/drain to reject new connections
* Add extensions/filter to filter messages, parts and quits with a Hyperscan database
* Add extensions/sasl_usercloak to interpolate SASL account names into I-line spoofs

conf
====

* **Breaking:** Completely overhaul oper privs. All privset configs will need to be rewritten.
  See reference.conf for details.
* Add the ``kline_spoof_ip`` I-line flag to make any spoof opaque to K-line matching
* Add general::\hide_tkline_duration to remove durations from user-visible ban reasons
* Add general::\hide_opers, which behaves as if all opers have oper:hidden
* Add general::\post_registration_delay
* Add general::\tls_ciphers_oper_only to hide TLS cipher details in :kbd:`/whois`
* Add channel::\opmod_send_statusmsg to send messages allowed by +z to @#channel
* Add class::\max_autoconn, with the behaviour of class::max_number for servers prior to
  charybdis 4
* Remove general::\kline_delay
* If m_webirc is loaded, connections that try to use a webirc auth block as their I-line will
  be disconnected on registration

misc
====

* **Breaking:** WEBIRC now processes the "secure" option as specified by IRCv3. Web gateways that
  do not set this option will need to be updated or their connections will show as insecure.

code
====

* Channel lists are now kept sorted. A for-loop macro, ``ITER_COMM_CHANNELS``, is introduced to
  efficiently compare two such lists.
